# Sales-Forecasting
## 🔹 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting *future sales* based on historical data.  
By applying *time series analysis & machine learning models*, the goal is to help businesses make data-driven decisions for inventory management and revenue planning.

## 🔹 Dataset

- Features: Date, Product Category, Region, Sales Volume, etc.  
- Target: Future Sales

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Statsmodels / Prophet (if used)

## 🔹 Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering  
4. Model Building (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Prophet, etc.)  
5. Model Evaluation (RMSE, MAE, R²)  
6. Forecasting future sales  

## 🔹 Results
